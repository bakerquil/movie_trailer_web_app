# movie_trailer_web_app


**About the Project**

Our group consisting of; Baker, Chris, David, Valli and Zoreah decided we would improve upon the movie information you typically see. We started by gathering the information from the OMDB api to display the pedigree information of the movie. Once we had the information from the movie displayed we wanted to give the user an opportunity to see the preview of the movie. We felt that we could improve on the user's experience by not just providing the official trailer but the Honest Trailer from the YouTube API. As an added bonus for the user we thought we would share with the user some available photos of the Actors/Actresses from the Google Image API.
